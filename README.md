# School-Performance-Analysis
Here I collated and cleaned the data of an educational establishment to derive key performance metrics. This analysis aimed to check each group's activity and factors that might have influenced their performance in school. From my analysis, we can identify the Best and Worst performing groups, Hours spent studying, and subject scores of each group.
